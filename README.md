# VELIB_PREDICTION_MODEL_EVALUATION
In this notebook we will evaluate the Velib prediction model

In this notebook, we are going to  :
Discover the Vélib real time data and prediction API
Automate the collection of data about the number of available bicycles and free docks every 10 minutes.
Visualize the data.
Calculate the mean absolute error of the Vélib prediction model.

Here is the result, go and see how we get to this :
